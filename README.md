# Unit 6.5 - Memory Game

This is my version of the Memory Game - Tetris Edition!

## Roadblocks
1. I spent too long on CSS and styling because I wasn't familiar with Flexbox, and I was caught up in trying to make it perfect.
2. I didn't efficiently write my JavaScript code, causing me to go back and fix it every time I would add a new change.
