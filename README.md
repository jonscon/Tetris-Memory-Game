# Memory Game - Tetris Edition

### What is it?
The objective of the game is to match two cards together until you fully match all pairs on the board. Users of all ages are welcome!

### Tech Stack
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the entire application due to the ease of implementation.

### Challenges and Roadblocks
1. I spent too long on CSS and styling because I wasn't familiar with Flexbox, and I was caught up in trying to make it perfect.
2. I didn't efficiently write my JavaScript code, causing me to go back and fix it every time I would add a new change.
